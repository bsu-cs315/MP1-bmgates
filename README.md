# Project 0: Dodge the Creeps!
A tutorial implementation by Brayden Gates.

This project follows the [Your First Game tutorial from
godotengine.org](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

## Project Report

While working through this first "mini-project" I got held up near the beginning, my player was only moving
once per button press instead of continuously, but I moved past it thinking it would fix itself (spoiler alert it did not).
Then after finishing the main and the HUD I tried to play the game again, this time nothing happened at all when
you pressed the start button. I tried to fix everything by comparing my script to the script in the example code,
although my was almost identical it still wasnâ€™t working. I decided to rest and give it a shot the next day,
this time I started all over. I decided to save my progress and test the game countless times while making it,
this helped me minimize my mistakes. The lesson I learned from this project is to never overlook
a small problem and test/save often.
